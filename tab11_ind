!=============================================================================

! HELP
! The tab11 table is used to assign fields to Direct indexes. Direct indexes 
! enable the user to retrieve a specific record. A direct index is suited to
! unique or almost unique identifiers of the record, and serves as quick
! access to a record.
! Direct indexes are also used by record loader and union view tables, in
! order to find possible matching records (candidates).
! The table is limited to 500 lines.

!                Subfield to filter. It is used together with column 4. For
!                example, if this column contains a '2' and column 4 contains
!                'usm50', then only records with usm50 in subfield 2
!                will have this field indexed;

!                Subfield contents filter;
!                Subfield contents filter. It is used together with column 3.
!                For example, if column 3 contains a '2' and this column
!                contains 'usm50', then only records with usm50 in subfield 2
!                will have this field indexed. If the contents is prefixed by 
!                a hyphen (minus), the content is considered negative.      
!                For example, if column 3 contains a '2' and this column
!                contains '-usm50', then only records that do not have
!                usm50 in subfield 2 will have this field indexed.
!                !!NOTE!! filter text must be entered in lower case
!                (irrespective of case in the record itself).
!                Use * to indicate truncated text; use # to
